# Button Functionality Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The frontend buttons were not functioning because the essential JavaScript files were commented out in most HTML pages. This prevented navigation, API calls, and authentication from working properly.

## Root Cause
The following JavaScript files were commented out across multiple pages:
- `js/api.js` - Handles API calls to Google Apps Script backend
- `js/nav.js` - Provides navigation functions (`goTo`, `requireAuth`, etc.)
- `js/shim.google.run.js` - Shims Google Apps Script functionality for GitHub Pages

## Files Fixed

### ✅ Fixed - JavaScript Includes Activated
1. **dashboard.html** - Added missing script includes (was completely missing them)
2. **view_vessel.html** - Uncommented HTML-style comments `<!-- ... -->`
3. **register_vessel.html** - Uncommented HTML-style comments
4. **register_client.html** - Uncommented HTML-style comments
5. **edit_vessel.html** - Uncommented HTML-style comments
6. **client_list.html** - Uncommented HTML-style comments
7. **edit_user.html** - Uncommented JavaScript-style comments `// ...`
8. **create_user.html** - Uncommented JavaScript-style comments
9. **change_password.html** - Uncommented JavaScript-style comments
10. **client_profile.html** - Uncommented JavaScript-style comments

### ✅ Already Working
- **login.html** - JavaScript files were already active

## Technical Details

### Script Loading Order
The correct loading order for GitHub Pages deployment:
```html
<script src="js/api.js"></script>
<script src="js/nav.js"></script>
<script src="js/shim.google.run.js"></script>
```

### Key Functions Restored
- **Navigation**: `goTo()` function for page transitions
- **Authentication**: `requireAuth()` for session management
- **API Calls**: `google.script.run` shim for backend communication
- **Button Handlers**: Click events using `data-goto` attributes

### Dashboard Button Functionality
The dashboard uses `data-goto` attributes that are handled by:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  const el = e.target.closest('[data-goto]');
  if (!el) return;
  e.preventDefault();
  navigate(el.getAttribute('data-goto'));
});
```

## Verification Steps
1. Open dashboard.html in browser
2. Verify buttons now respond to clicks
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (should be minimal)
4. Test navigation between pages

## Notes on Lint Errors
Some lint errors remain due to server-side template syntax (`<?= ... ?>`) which is normal for Google Apps Script templates but shows as errors in static analysis.

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure `js/` folder is properly deployed to GitHub Pages
- Verify CORS and API connectivity to Google Apps Script backend
- Check that the `GAS_BASE` URL in `js/api.js` points to the correct deployment
